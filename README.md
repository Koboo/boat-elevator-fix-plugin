# Boat Elevator Fix

This is a tiny plugin, which prevents the player from getting ejected, while using a bubble
column/water elevator with a boat.

There is no configuration, and it works in both directions,
upwards (soul sand) and downwards (magma blocks).

## Supported Versions

Java: ``<= Java 11``
